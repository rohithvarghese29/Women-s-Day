<main><p>"The one thing I wear best is my confidence. That’s what I’d recommend to everyone. It’s a big turn on.” – Priyanka Chopra</p></main>
<main><p>“Because you are women, people will force their thinking on you, their boundaries on you. They will tell you how to dress, how to behave, who you can meet and where you can go. Don't live in the shadows of people's judgment. Make your own choices in the light of your own wisdom.” - Amitabh Bachchan
</p></main>
<main><p>“I alone cannot change the world. But I can cast a stone across the waters to create many ripples.” – Mother Teresa</p></main>
<main><p>“No struggle can ever succeed without women participating side by side with men. There are two powers in the world; one is the sword and the other is the pen. There is a third power stronger than both, that of women.” - Malala Yousafzai</p></main>
<main><p>“Feminism isn't about making women strong. Women are already strong. It's about changing the way the world perceives that strength.” - G.D. Anderson</p></main>
<main><p>“I don't want other people to decide who I am. I want to decide that for myself.” Emma Watson</p></main>
<main><p>"I think the best role models for women are people who are fruitfully and confidently themselves, who bring light into the world." —Meryl Streep</p></main>
<main><p>"A woman with a voice is, by definition, a strong woman." - Melinda Gates</p></main>
<main><p>May each and every moment of your day be filled with happiness. Happy Women’s Day!</p></main>
